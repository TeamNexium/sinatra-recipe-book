Recipe Book

For this assignment I have decided to build an app called “Cook Book Nook” for sharing recipes between the users of the app.

The front page invites existing users to log in or new guests to sign up. After logging into the app, the user is redirected to the main page, where the list of all existing recipes can be found. This page contains a link for creating a new recipe.

The page for the new recipe renders a form, that includes fields for the name, ingredients, and cooking instructions. The user has also an option of uploading an image of the meal.

The user can edit or delete recipes, however, these actions are obviously only be available for their own recipes.

This is a pretty simple app, and one can think of lots of other features that can be added here, like add the recipes to favourites, rate them, create a separate section of the websites for drinks and cocktails, etc. I hope to try and add these features if I return to this project in the future.
